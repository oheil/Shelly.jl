    ll, ls;  dir (on Windows)
    <N>cd  or  <N>° -- examples: '3cd' or '3°'
    ldf

`ll`,.. are shortcuts/constants that list the current dir's contents in the Julia REPL mode.

`cd`, preceded by a number shown in the `ll`-ouput, changes dir, for example `4cd`. The second entry of `ll` is always the parent dir "..", so `2cd` moves one dir up (`cc` does the same). `0cd` goes to your home dir.

Linuxy-only for now: `ldf` shows mounts; their negative indices can be used with `cd`, as in `-4cd`.
